# Course Project Deliverables

This is an outline of the deliverables you will complete over the course of the class. In the interests of simulating the experience of working in industry, we prefer to call these _deliverables_ rather than _assignments_. These will be a mixture of presentations, written documentation, code artifacts, and/or actual running programs. 

For listing of dates and how these line up with topics, refer to the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md).

## Regular Deliverables
### Sprint Retro Notes
You should run a brief retro meeting after each sprint and take notes. These notes should be posted on your team Github repo.
### User Stories
Project teams will write out their user stories and have them entered into the issue tracking system. These should be updated at least weekly.

## One-Off Deliverables
### Individual Project Pitches
Students will come up with ideas for projects and present them to the class.
#### Requirements
* Must be a novel idea (not already implemented somewhere else or be a major variation of an existing product or service)
* Some description of how it will be made, the technologies used, etc.
* Some statement of why or how this will be useful.
#### Example
> I would like to make Instragram for dinosaurs, e.g. _Dinogram_. This will be a mobile app that runs COBOL on the backend. I think this is useful because dinosaurs need a social media presence.
### Team Product Proposals
Teams will be formed and their product proposals will be presented to the class
#### Requirements
* Must be a novel idea or team member's adaptation from the individual project pitches
* Adhere to the product definition section [Product Thinking](https://github.com/appnexus/capstone-course/blob/master/notes/PRODUCT.md) defining the target audience, problem, vision, strategy and goals.
* Some description of how it will be made, the technologies used, etc.
### Data-driven Prototype and Presentation
Project applications will have a working data persistence and storage component and be demonstrated.

Presentations should consist of the following:
* Brief demo of the prototype (whatever you have "working" so far)
* Presentation and discussion of challenges that the team has encountered and overcome
* Presentation and discussion of challenges that the team has encountered and is still struggling with
### Final Demo
Each product or application will be demonstrated to show all available features or capabilities.

## Unused Deliverables
### UX storyboards and wireframes
Each user story or set of related user stories will have UX storyboards or wireframes completed and entered into the issue tracking system
### UI Prototype
A working user-interface application will be written and demonstrated
### MVP Demo
Minimal viable product demonstrations will prove that the project application has its core features implemented fully.
