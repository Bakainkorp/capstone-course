# Capstone Course Curriculum

## Summary

This curriculum is developed by [AppNexus](https://www.appnexus.com/en) as part of our contribution to the [Tech in Residence](http://www.techtalentpipeline.nyc/tech-in-residence-corps/) program. The course topics will introduce [Hunter College](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/csci/curriculum) students enrolled in the computer science capstone course to a breadth of topics in modern, web-based software development. We will provide students with different modes of thinking, and highlight each topic with useful readings and case studies. We expect students to meaningfully apply what they have learned in each topic to their capstone projects and to take away a sense of the intellectual challenges we face in our software development careers.
