# Design & UX Thinking

## In general

Design thinking can be summarized with the question: _"how do I empower users to solve a problem with as little effort as possible"?_. This goes beyond the mindset of simply completing a project for your capstone course, but rather making deliberate choices to _design_ something _usable_ that solves a specific problem.

## Questions for inquiry

* What is a 'user experience'?
* What is 'usability'?
	* What does it mean for a system or application to be usable?
	* What makes something _not_ usable?
* What are methods to uncover 'usability'?
* How do we know how our users will perform using our application or system?
