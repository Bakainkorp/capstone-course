# Design & UX Thinking

## In general

Design thinking can be summarized with the question: _"how do I empower users to solve their problems with as little effort as possible"?_

## Questions for inquiry

* What is 'usability'?
* How do we define 'usability'?
* What are methods to uncover 'usability'?
* How do we know how our users will perform using our application or system?
