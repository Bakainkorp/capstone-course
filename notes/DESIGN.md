# Design & UX Thinking

## In general

Design thinking can be summarized with the question: _"how do I empower users to solve a problem with as little effort as possible"?_. This goes beyond the mindset of simply completing a project for your capstone course, but rather making deliberate choices to _design_ something _usable_ that solves a specific problem.

## Questions for inquiry

* What is a 'user experience'?
** ["an ideology supported by an accompanying process"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/)
* What is 'usability'?
	* What does it mean for a system or application to be [usable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)?
	* What makes something _not_ usable?
	* [What makes something frustrating to the user?](https://uxdesign.cc/if-satan-was-a-web-designer-dc5cdf06dff9)
* What are methods to uncover 'usability'?
* How do we know how our users will perform using our application or system?
