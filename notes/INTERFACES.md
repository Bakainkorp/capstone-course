# User Interface Systems

## In general

A user interface is anything in your system with which your user interacts. These are typically anything in your system that your user senses - through vision, hearing, and feeling, and to which your user responds - through touch, motion, voice, or even [thought](https://youtu.be/bposG6XHXvU?t=77).

One of the most common user interfaces is the one rght in front of you - you are probably reading these notes on a web page, which is rendered in a browser and displayed on a computer screen. This screen is either a stand-alone monitor, a part of a laptop, a tablet, a cell phone etc. If you are visually impaired you might be assisted by a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or [refreshable braille display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display).

Building good user interfaces takes a good understanding of [product](/notes/PRODUCT.md) and is the embodiment of a well-thought-out [user experience](/notes/DESIGN.md). This holds true whether you are building a web-enabled application for a mobile- or a full-screen device.

## Questions for inquiry

* What platforms enable you to build user interfaces for multiple platforms? (screen sizes, operating systems, etc.)
* What hardware platforms are available to augment the user interface in a web application?
