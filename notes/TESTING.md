## General Idea

How do I ensure that the product I create lives up to its expectations (from myself, clients, etc) before, during, and after coding?

## Questions for inquiry

* What exactly _is_ testing?
* What are helpful and simple strategies to develop tests?
* How should testing my product, even just thinking about testing it, influence its design and development?
